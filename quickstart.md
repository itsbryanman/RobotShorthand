## Step 1: Add Personalization Settings

Update ChatGPT’s personalization settings to recognize Robot Shorthand flags.

### **Option 1: "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"**
> *"Use shorthand flags for tailored responses: -SH (short), -LO (long), -FO (formal), -CA (casual), -ST (step-by-step). Example: ‘Explain black holes -SH -SI.’”*

### **Option 2: "What would you like ChatGPT to know about you?"**
> *"I will use Robot Shorthand flags to customize responses. ChatGPT should recognize these flags and adjust tone, length, and style accordingly (e.g., -SH for short, -BU for bullets, -DE for detailed). Example: ‘Describe gravity -LO -EX.’”*
